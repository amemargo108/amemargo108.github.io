Band website: Website for metal band Vaelravyn

#Vaelravyn website

This website was created for the band Vaelravyn, based out of Nashville, TN. They've started getting traction in Nashville, and wanted a website built so people could find them outside of social media.

It's composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - using mainly BootStrap to build it.

Currently hosted at - https://amemargo108.github.io/
Working on getting it hosted at a custom domain for them.
